# LAW BLOCKS

  A listing of all federal laws will be transcribed into individual blocks on a block chain
  
  Private keys will be generated for each block that will be stored in a voter ballot controlled private block
 
  Only upon a majority vote will new blocks be added or existing blocks be altered or removed
  
  The security of the voting system will be assured by each blocks veto vote record being publicly listed on each block.
 
  Each voting individual will be able to verify that their voter uid was entered in as their correct choice. 

  A one month delay will be added to ensure ample time is given for all users to verify the information before a block is modified     in any way
