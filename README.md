# We-The-People-Plan

  An opportunity exists today that has never before existed in the entire recorded history of humanity.
We have available to us the means to both securely and anonymously connect with all other people via the internet.

  It stands to reason, that had this been possible when we founded these united states, we likely would have structured our representation quite differently. 
  
  We as citizens of this country have the right and also the responsibility to ensure our representation is both fair and just.

  Greed has corrupted our current government at its most fundamental levels. We shall then change the structure of our government in such a way that greed cannot control it.

  A proposal to amend the constitution is made as such, that an interjection be added to the checks and balances system between congress and the presidential power of veto that grants a majority of voters the power of veto. This newly implemented Peoples Veto shall be implemented by means of the internet.
  
The peoples veto may be used retro-actively to veto existing laws whenever a majority vote calls for it.

The peoples power of veto shall not be overridden.

Internet access shall be made available to all citizens as needed for voting purposes at public institutions
